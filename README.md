# servicerless-typescript 
A modular approach to developing serverless application using AWS, Serverless, TypeScript and Node.

* Change the organisation name in serverless.yml as your serverles.com account.
* Deploy the database-service first.
* Then deploy the department-service.
* Sample body for department insert is {"deptId":"D01","deptName":"IT","deptLocation":"Unit1"}
* Sample body for department remove is {"deptId":"D01"}
